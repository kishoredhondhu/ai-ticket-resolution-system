## 💡 Why this project

IT helpdesks are drowning in repetitive tickets. This repository demonstrates how to combine TF-IDF retrieval, lightweight AI generation, and a modern UX to unlock automated, auditable recommendations while keeping humans in the loop. It runs locally, on Railway, or anywhere Docker/Nixpacks is available.

---

## ✨ Key capabilities

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** powered by TF-IDF vectors for millisecond similarity search without GPU costs.
- **AI fallback logic** (see `backend/AI_FALLBACK_FEATURE.md`) to generate templated or Hugging Face completions when premium models are unavailable.
- **Insightful metrics** collected through `metrics_tracker` and exposed via `/api/metrics` + `/api/metrics/realtime` for dashboards.
- **Modern SPA frontend** (React 19 + Vite + TypeScript) with contexts, hooks, i18n, and Vitest coverage.
- **Deployment-ready tooling** (Railway manifests, Nixpacks config, `test-before-deploy` scripts, Procfile) to keep releases safe.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- pip + virtualenv (or uv/poetry if you prefer)
- npm or pnpm
- Git

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kishoredhondhu/ai-ticket-resolution-system.git
cd ai-ticket-resolution-system
```

### 2. Bootstrap the backend (FastAPI RAG service)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/build_knowledge_base_tfidf.py   # creates data/knowledge_base.pkl
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Backend defaults to `http://localhost:8000` and exposes Swagger at `/docs`.

### 3. Bootstrap the frontend (React + Vite)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

SPA runs on `http://localhost:5173` and proxies API calls via `VITE_API_URL`.

### 4. One-liner helpers

- `start.sh` / `test-before-deploy.bat`: orchestrate both apps and smoke tests.
- `check-deployment-ready.(sh|bat)`: executes lint + test gates before pushing.

---

## 📁 Knowledge base workflow

1. Place your historical tickets in `backend/data/Sample-Data.xlsx` (or update the script path).
2. Run `python scripts/build_knowledge_base_tfidf.py` to generate `knowledge_base.pkl`.
3. The RAG engine auto-reloads via `/api/reload-knowledge-base` when new data is available.
4. Metrics for retrieval quality and response time are persisted in `backend/data/rag_metrics.json` for inspection.

> Tip: schedule the build script in your CI/CD or data pipeline so the knowledge base stays fresh.

        "description": "Teams is stuck at signing in"
      }'
```

---

## 🧪 Testing & quality

| Layer | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend unit/integration | `python -m pytest` | Covers fallback logic (`test_ai_fallback.py`), Azure reachability, endpoints, and evaluation harnesses |
| Frontend unit/UI | `npm run test` or `npm run test:coverage` | Uses Vitest + Testing Library + happy-dom |
| Frontend linting | `npm run lint` | ESLint + TypeScript ESLint config |
| Full pre-deploy | `./test-before-deploy.bat` (Win) / `./check-deployment-ready.sh` | Runs both stacks' tests, ideal for CI |

Add these commands to GitHub Actions or Railway's CI hooks to keep the main branch green.

## ☁️ Deployment to Railway

1. **Push to GitHub** (`main` branch). Ensure `railway.json` references your repo and `nixpacks.toml` is committed.
2. **Provision services**
   - Backend → FastAPI + uvicorn (uses Procfile / `start.sh`).
   - Frontend → Static build via Vite or serve via the FastAPI static mount (`frontend/dist`).
3. **Configure Railway variables**
   - Add backend secrets (Azure/HF tokens, thresholds).
   - Add `VITE_API_URL` pointing to the backend service URL.
4. **Trigger build**
   - Railway uses Nixpacks to install Python + Node sub-builds automatically.
   - `test-before-deploy.bat` or `check-deployment-ready.sh` can be run locally to mimic Railway build steps.
5. **Verify**
   - Hit `/health` and `/api/suggest-resolution` from the Railway domain.

> Prefer a single Railway service by running `npm run build` and letting FastAPI serve `frontend/dist`, or split into two services if you want independent scaling.

## 📈 Monitoring & metrics

- `metrics_tracker` captures latency, confidence, success/fallback counts, and category distribution.
- `/api/metrics` returns aggregated stats (p50/p95 latency, resolution confidence averages).
- `/api/metrics/realtime` returns the last 100 requests for dashboards or Grafana.
- Metrics are stored in `backend/data/rag_metrics.json` so you can persist or ship them to your observability stack.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Backend fails with `RAG engine not initialized` | Ensure `data/knowledge_base.pkl` exists (run `scripts/build_knowledge_base_tfidf.py`) and that the path matches `RAGEngine` constructor. |
| Frontend cannot reach API | Confirm backend is running on port 8000, update `VITE_API_URL`, and check CORS in `app.py`. |
| Hugging Face rate limits | Provide `HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN` or reduce traffic; fallback templates still work without AI. |
| Azure OpenAI 403 errors | Usually firewall/network; connect to VPN or whitelist your IP. The fallback pipeline keeps user experience intact. |
| Railway build timeouts | Cache dependencies with Nixpacks (`nixpacks.toml`) and prune `node_modules` before commits. |
